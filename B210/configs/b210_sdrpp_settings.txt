B210 SDR++ Configuration Guide
================================

FM Radio Band (88-108 MHz) Settings:

1. SOURCE SETTINGS:
   - Source: UHD
   - Device: type=b200 (or select "Custom_SDR_B210")
   - Sample Rate: 2.4 MSPS or 3.2 MSPS (start with 2.4)
   - Antenna: RX2 (NOT TX/RX since you only have one antenna)

2. GAIN SETTINGS:
   - The B210 has different gain structure than Cariboulite
   - Total RX gain range: 0-76 dB
   - For FM radio, try these settings:
     * Start with 40-50 dB gain
     * Adjust until signal is around -40 to -60 dBFS
   - In SDR++, look for "PGA" gain control

3. FREQUENCY:
   - Center: 98.5 MHz (for your station)
   - Make sure you're in the right mode (WFM for FM broadcast)

4. BANDWIDTH:
   - FM broadcast: 200 kHz per station
   - Set SDR++ bandwidth to at least 200 kHz

5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If no signal:
     a) Check antenna is connected to RX2 port (NOT TX/RX)
     b) Increase gain to 60-70 dB
     c) Verify frequency is correct
     d) Check that UHD is using the right device

   - If signal is weak compared to Cariboulite:
     The B210 may need higher gain settings
     Cariboulite's "34 AGC" != B210's gain scale
     Try 50-70 dB on the B210

6. EXPECTED SIGNAL LEVELS:
   - Strong FM station: -40 to -60 dBFS
   - Weak station: -70 to -90 dBFS
   - Noise floor: -100 to -120 dBFS

7. SAMPLE RATE NOTES:
   - B210 supports: 200 kHz to 56 MHz
   - Good starting rates: 2.4, 3.2, 4.0, 8.0 MSPS
   - Higher rates = more bandwidth but more CPU

Quick Test Command (terminal):
uhd_fft -f 98.5e6 -s 2.4e6 -g 50 --args="type=b200"
